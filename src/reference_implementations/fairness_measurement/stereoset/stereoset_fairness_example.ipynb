For inter-sentence samples, each sample has a piece of context followed by 3 sentences, where each sentence would have an associated label of \"stereotype,\" \"anti-stereotype,\" and \"unrelated,\" and the prompt should be constructed as context + sentence. For intra-sentence samples, the context for each sample would have a \"BLANK\" to be filled, and the 3 sentences would fill the \"BLANK\" with different text.\n",

    "Stereotype sentence: ```The people are very thin and good at distance running.```\n",

For example, in the inter-sentence example above, we might prefer the model to assign the highest likelihood to the unrelated sentence (or even the stereotype sentence), but in the intra-sentence example, the ideal language model would assign stereotype and anti-stereotype sentences equal likelihoods."

However, LLaMA-2 provides a very interesting result here. Of the three choices provided, the anti-stereotype sentence is assigned more than twice the likelihood of the stereotype sentence. Moreover, the stereotypical sentence receives a nearly equal probability to that of the unrelated sentence. In other words, LLaMA-2 thinks \"The chess player\" is as likely to be a fox or an Asian person. This is pretty surprising, but also not what we expected with respect to stereotype.\n",
