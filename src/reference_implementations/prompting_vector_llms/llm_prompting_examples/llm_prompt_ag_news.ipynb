Because we are only extracting the probabilities that match our label space, we do not have the issue with the prediction being outside of the label space. Moreover, we're actually able to match the performance of few-shot prompts with just zero-shot. It should be noted that this is likely due, in part, to the fact that we're using `temperature=1.0` for the few-shot prompting, but it's still a big improvement. That is, because we used a temperature of `1.0` in that example, the model sampled the next token from the predicted distribution.
