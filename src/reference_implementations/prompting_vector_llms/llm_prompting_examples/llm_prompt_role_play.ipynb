    "The original paper provided some evidence that role-play prompting can work better than CoT in many tasks, but in their case the model was able to acknowledge its role on its own, so there was no need to artificially create a fake response. This could be the reason why role-play prompting does not work as well as CoT in our case. Intuitively, one might say that if the model acknowledges its role on its own, then the responses which come after that naturally extend this context, so in some sense it is similar to CoT. \n",

    "We can also observe that in Levels 1 and 2, the model gave some incoherent responses which suggest it did not immerse itself in the role of a math teacher. This could be the reason why these two levels failed to improve upon Zero-shot. The model we are using here (LLaMA-2-70b) has not been fine-tuned for chat purposes, so it is harder to induce conversation-like behaviour from the model, which can be important for role-play prompting to work. A natural follow-up experiment one might want to run to verify this idea is to use a model that has been fine-tuned for chat purposes.\n"
